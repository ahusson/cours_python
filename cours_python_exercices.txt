## EXERCISES ##


## STRINGS

5. Same as 2. for the area of the house.



## CONTROL FLOW

6. Create a program that prompts the user for their latest grade, check whether their grade is between 0 to 20 included, and display their letter grade on screen according to the following scheme:
[0, 5[ -> "F"
[5, 10[ -> "D"
[10, 15[ -> "C"
[15, 18[ -> "B"
[18, 20] -> "A"



7. Given a list of integers l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Write a for-loop to display the following output:
...The current value is: 1
...The current value is: 2
...The current value is: 3
...The current value is: 4
...The current value is: 5


8. Same as 6 but with a while-loop.


9. Given the following list of strings l = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], return the sum of the integer values. The output should be the sum of the integers from 1 to 5 included, so 15.


10. Create a program that prompts the user for an integer strictly greater than 1 and display True if that number is prime, False otherwise.


11. Create a program that reads the content of myfile.txt using the read method and displays it on screen.



## BUILTIN TYPES - LISTS

12. Given the following list l = [34, 45, 67, 89], create a program that displays the 3rd element on screen.


13. Given the following list l = [34, 45, 67, 89], create a program that increments the 2nd element by 1.


14. Given a list l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], create a program that reverses the list and displays the result on screen.


15. Given an empty list l = [], create a program that fills the list with all integers up to 20 included. Use the range function.


16. Same as 15. but do NOT use the range function.


17. Same as 15. but only include the even integers. You may or may not use the range function.


18. Given the following list l = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], create a program that prompts the user for a number between 1 to 10 included and displays True if the number is in l, or False otherwise.


19. Given the following list l = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], create a program that displays the minimum number in the list.


20. Same as 19. but for the maximum.


21. Given the following list l = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], create a program that removes (Hint: pops) the last element from the list and displays that element on screen.


22. Same as 21. but for the element at index 2.


23. Given the following list l = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], create a program that displays the number of element in the list. Use the function "len".


24. Same as 23. but do NOT use "len".


25. Given a list l = [45, 34, 25, 105, 546, 1, 32], create a program that sorts the list in ascending order, then display the result on screen.


26. Create a program that displays a list containing the square of each integer from 1 to 10 included, and do so using list comprehension.



## BUILTIN TYPES - SETS


27. Given a list l = [1, 2, 3], cast the list to a type "set" and display the result.


28. Given a list l = [1, 1, 2, 3], cast the list to type "set" and display the result. Notice what happened ?


29. Given 2 sets s1 = {1, 2} and s2 = {1, 3}, create a program that displays the intersection of those 2 sets. Here the "intersection" is to be understood in the mathematical sense.


30. Given 2 sets s1 = {1, 2} and s2 = {1, 3}, create a program that returns True if s1 is a subset of s2, or False otherwise. Here being a "subset of" is to be understood in the mathematical sense.


31. Same as 30. but for the following new sets s1 = {1, 2} and s2 = {1, 2, 3}.



## BUILTIN TYPES - DICTS


32. Given a list l = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], create a dict that contains the elements from the list l as a key and the number of occurences of that element in l as a value.


33. Given a dictionary d = {"a": 23, "b": 45, "c": 2}, create a program that displays the keys of the dict d. Hint: Try using the "keys" method.


34. Given a dictionary d = {"a": 23, "b": 45, "c": 2}, create a program that displays the values of the dict d. Hint: Try using the "values" method.


35. Given a dictionary d = {"a": 23, "b": 45, "c": 2}, create a program that displays the key-value pairs in the following format

...key = a value = 23
...key = b value = 45
...key = c value = 2

Hint: Try using the "items" method.


36. Given a dictionary d = {"a": 23, "b": 45, "c": 2}, create a program that removes the key-value pair associated to the "a" key and displays it on screen.


37. (HARDER)
Given an integer s = 10 and a list l = [1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 10], create a program that creates a set of all pairs of integers (i, j) such that i + j = s. The output given the variables s and l above should be {(3, 7), (5, 5)} (notice (3, 7) a,d (7, 3) are duplicates so only one is needed.)


38. Create a program that reads the content of myotherfile.txt and displays each line on screen. The out put should look something like:
... content of line 1
... content of line 2
... etc.

Hint: try using the readlines method
